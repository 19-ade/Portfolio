* Bachelor of Engineering - BE, *Electronics and Instrumentation*, Bits Pilani, Hyderabad Campus (2019 - 2023)
* Minor , *Robotics and Automation* , Bits Pilani, Hyderabad Campus (2021 - 2023)

## [Project 1](https://github.com/19-ade/RL_dino_try) : Using Reinforcement Learning to train AI to play Google Chrome Dinosaurs Game 

* The Screenshot of the game environment was taken and the pixel value was optimized using OpenCV library in Python.
* A Deep Q Network algorithm was used to train the agent
* A Convolutional Neural Network was used to analyze the pixel data
* A Custom Gym environment was created to access the game on Google chrome and manipulate it. 

## [Project 2](https://github.com/19-ade/Reinforcement-Learning-projects-on-predesigned-gym-environments): Applying Reinforcement Learning Algorithms on gym environment 

Using standard Gym environments I have used various algorithms like Q table and Deep Q Network to teach the agent in solving the environments. Some Examples include:

* Highway-env – The main task in this environment is for the agent is to navigate a car in traffic by slowing down, increasing speed or changing lanes
* MountainCar-v0 and MountainCarContinuous-v0– The task was to carry the vehicle up a mountain in an under-powered car. The Agent had to learn to move the car back and forth to develop momentum.
* CartPole-v0 – The agent had to learn to make minute changes in position in the cart which in turn balances a rod and keeps it upright. 

## [Project 3](https://github.com/19-ade/tit-Bits): Minute Python projects  

To exercise my knowledge and my desire to learn I implemented the following python scripts in my day-to-day functioning:

* A PDF to excel/LaTeX/csv format converter
* Solving ordinary point series, regular singular series and hypergeometric series 
* A web-scraper application which scrapes the pdf slides and documents from the professor’s website . This was achieved using python library beautifulsoup4 and requests
* A calculator and a basic text editor using the python tkinter library
